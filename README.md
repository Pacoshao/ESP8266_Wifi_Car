# ESP8266_Wifi_Car
This is a project about ESP8266...
If you want to do this project,you need:

ESP8266 * 2

Motor drive board * 1

Arduino * 1

Remote potentiometer * 1

Some connection cables...

The Arduino need to use Serial port to send message to one of the ESP8266...
Then the ESP8266 will send message to another ESP8266.
After that,the ESP8266 will Drive the motors...
So the Car will run.
Maybe it will turn left,turn right,go forward or go back.

I will add an ultrasonic sensor later...
